0,i am in love with these full rounds for each individual player.
1,Who else wants to hit that guy shouting ‘that’s Gucci bro’
2,I just love watching koepka play golf! Amazing player!
3,"this major is already his... dude balls out when it counts the most, what i like about this dude"
4,A scratch golfer will have a hard time break 85 here...   He shot 128 in 2 rounds at this course?!?   You gotta be kidding.....
5,Quality content thank you PGA
6,"Said in his interview, ""I really struggled out there"". Shoots 65. lol"
7,18:40 Ball tracer had a mind of its own.
8,Love this content. Thanks for putting it up!
9,Dude be losing a putt putt battle but u know he ain’t losing a Majors battle
10,"By the end of the week he will have   six wins on tour, four being majors."
11,Somewhere gucci bro guy is hard with this comment section.
12,"This is tiger-esque when he ripped apart Pebble. Crazy performance so far. He's shown no signs of it, but if your driver starts to fail you on this course you can start unraveling. Let's see if he can finish this thing out in style."
13,I am inevitable - Brooks Koepka
14,What a display of raw talent and power
15,Who are the idiots yelling in the bunker when he hits.
16,"That kind of day when your a world class golfer and you are bringing your A game, Brooks is literally living the dream."
17,wanna know what's not gucci? probably nothing on that guy's outfit who kept yelling it :P
18,"a power player like this doesnt always look fluid but Koepka's got both , guy is a machine"
19,"probably thc oil in those nike soles, better check them"
20,why do some Americans consistently sound like complete buffoons? #thatsguccibro
21,"7:50
This guy who screams that’s Gucci every shot please show me who he is 😂😂"
22,I could have 128 in one round with a couple of mulligans each nine.
23,"Zzz, no wind and rain. I was hoping even par would be winning score :/"
24,Koepka is keeping the Golden Bear record safe and keeping Tiger at bay. Well played.
25,"Either his drivers have a face angle of 45 degrees, or this flight path software is pretty crap."
26,Wish I could teletransport him back to 1997.
27,Cant decide if I like that hat??
28,"""IS THERE NO ONE ELSE!? IS THERE NO ONE ELSE!?"" - Achilles Koepka"
29,"Go Tiger! C'mon Tiger! Hoot Hoot Tiger!

Brookes: Hold my beer...."
30,Thank you PGA! Being a channel for the people with these shot complications!
31,One bad ass golfer...flying 255m with a 3wood and stops on a dinner table
32,So five hours on the course results in 20 minutes of gameplay. Interesting.
33,He s walking around like Russell Crowe in Gladiator .
34,"Quite a Long game Clinic, that's for real. It's kinda scary"
35,He's playing like Jack Nicklaus.  Aim it left and hit a high cut.  Hard to beat that.  Best driver of the ball today!
36,I didn't likehim a while ago but man he is one of my favorites. I hope he win
37,"Ok, there are two Golfers. DJ and Koepka. I’m very impressed of his shots from tee, but I am very much impressed of his 2nd shots from the fairway. What an accuracy. Wow!"
38,I could do better...I think on those old Tiger Woods games.
39,This is crazy. -12 over two rounds and I would argue that Koepka has even been a little unlucky with some very closely missed putts.
40,I bet Tiger wishes he could draw crowds like Koepka
41,No weakness.  None.  Brooks Koepka has the most complete golf skill set ever.
42,"If he can play short game consistent, he will be next tiger"
43,"As my ex wife used to say, length matters.......... in driver shots."
44,Is it just me or does koepka open his stance quite a lot for pretty much every shot? even for his straight shots
45,In hole 2 a guy said it’s Gucci bruh
46,Itʻs funny knowing that this guy fly some par 4ʻs in the world without even trying
47,Stop putting the score in the title please. It completely removes the anticipation. Thanks.
48,"""Koepka and Dj's great speed control"" (yeah with a driver at 120+ speeds) leaves one short, ""that's the third time he's left one short"" as always announcers really know golf well"
49,It's weird every time they show kept shot on the Green there's another ball there that's better
50,"I appreciate this course is difficult but for me it’s not a ‘major’ golf tournament. The course has no TV entertainment. Boring holes ..the only risk reward is clearing a bunker or rough at 290 from the tee.
PGA got it wrong with this course"
51,6:30 Goddamn that lady is thicc in the background
52,Wow. He is manhandling Bethpage black.
53,This guy is so much better than the field this week it’s scary. Absolutely amazing to watch.
54,He looks like something out of a computer game.
55,"..........COME ON, TIGER!......."
56,"He said he didn’t hit it that good, and he left a bunch of putts short in the jaws yet he’s running away with this major. The guy just knows how to play the majors"
57,"This has become boring, dude has won the tournament"
58,"I completely understand why people hate the guys yelling “it’s Gucci bruh” but I have no idea why people hate when HE says “that’s Gucci bruh”. Koepka is an absolute freak of a golfer, and when someone with that level of skill adds personality to the game it’s great for golf. He said it himself that the game is slow and boring, at least this adds personality to it."
59,20:42 camera guy didnt know what the hell was happening
60,This man is running a clinic on these dudes
61,Why do the commentators make like they are close friends of the player
62,Gucci!!
63,This guy is the real deal...watch him over the next decade!...and doesn't seem to take any shit from anyone!!
64,Koepka destroys woods in head to head match first couple of days but tiger will be back. Still two majors to go.
65,"""WAOW"""
66,playing so well
67,"How about those idiots saying ""get in the bunker"" after some of his shots? Wow. He's your own country man trying to make history..."
68,Machine plain & simple.
69,Jack  set  the  bar... Tiger  raised it....   This   guy  is in a diffrent   class!!... pure  majic⛳⛳⛳⛳
70,"Those dickheads yelling ""Gucci"" need to be lined up and shot."
71,15:06 what a crisp shot!
72,"This Round could have been another 63 very easy, but then the 63 yesterday's round could have been a 60 pretty easily.  He gives himself so many chances for birdie and his putting is deftly.  The toughest venue for the Majors this year, and Brooks is making it look like my public county course! Trying to find a hole in his game and you won't come up with even a pinhole.  Just completely awesome!"
73,This is just total domination. Hopefully the PGA will get the message that length is the only way to challenge the best golfers. This course is too wide open for a guy like Keopka and the rough isn't penal enough
74,Did they let koepka go off yellows??
75,Nicely done!go Koepka!!!!
76,That round... was Gucci brah.
77,12:20 Get in the bunker! WTF?
78,the 18th needs more bunkering.......
79,Does this guy have any weaknesses? That's ridiculous
80,"18:04 ""lets go Tiger""?.... what?"
81,Brandel hows brooks doin?
82,Brooks Klutchka
83,12:24 NY crowd are something else.
84,That 3 wood on 13 was just disgusting
85,Awesome Brooks 👍👍👏👏
86,"12:24 ""Get in the bunker"" hahahahahahahhahaha"
87,Something to be learned from this dude's putting too. He lines up the putt with the toe of his putter and then he hits it in the middle of the blade. Great thing about this is that it keeps him busy and focused on the execution of the putt. Keeps you the moment rather than your mind wandering off to the mechanics of the stroke or the hole.
88,Great Round by Brooks
89,I am a Koepka fan. Officially on the band wagon. The man's swing is like a Gucci Hemi Tag Hauer Rolex Detroit Deisel Mercedes Jag... Brah.
90,"How does Brooks do that? 300yd drives drop on a dime. I think Tiger got there too early, over prepared or something."
91,"골프입문 1주년 기념라운드때,
이븐파 기록ᆢ"
92,That’s Gucci bro
93,This fooking guy
94,Tiger fans are ruthless
95,THATS GUCCI BRUV
96,Greatness.  Reminds me of 97 tiger.  Just supreme talent.
97,14:52 'lets go Tigger!'
98,"Koepka IS A MACHINE and just about UNSTOPPABLE in Majors !! The best part of the last two days was that WASHED UP CHEATER Woods had to watch EVERY MAGNIFICENT SHOT Koepka hit , lol !! The second best part is ALL YOU WOODS LOVING LOSERS can now go CRAWL BACK UNDER THE ROCKS FROM WHICH YOU CAME since your FADED PIECE OF SHIT HERO Woods MISSED THE CUT !! He probably won't be seen again until the U.S. Open where he'll play ANOTHER TWO ROUNDS AND MISS THE CUT AGAIN !!"
99,"Say what u want haters, 287 in the air on the 13th, beast mode!!"
100,It's the shoes
101,Legend
102,"그래서 나도 8개월째,

103,"@12:25 Someone shouting ""In the Bunker"", wth!"
104,Unstoppable
105,역시 ㅡ 장타치니ㆍ골프쉽네 ㅋ
106,Nice shoes ♥
107,This guy is unbelievable
108,What a round👍
109,"""that's Gucci bro"" 
-Anonymous"
110,This guy
111,sicko
112,"Koepka is 29 and he has won 6 times. By the same age, Tiger had won 37 times including his record breaking 1997 and  2000 seasons and he had several major championship victories. In one season (2000) Tiger won 9 times, which is more than Koepka has won in his entire 10 year career. The ""Koepka is the goat"" people are delusional. Like Sherman said don't talk about the best!"
113,ケプカやばすぎ
114,"The guy is a machine, has no personality though."
115,"Saw the tiger one yesterday and was like meh

This is more like it"
116,15:01 is just disgusting
117,"1:11 ""That's Gucci, bro."""
118,o.
119,"I remember watching this guy years ago when he first came on the tour, thinking, this guy should be winning more, well hes answered that one."
120,"problem is you can be all attitude, downing your fellow players, acting like this isn't hard and that you actually didn't want to be a golfer. 

But that won't endear fans or people to support you, It will make you a villain & hopefully he grows up and figures that out before it's too late."
121,why are yanks so loud people dont need to hear you
122,C'monman
123,That’s Gucci bro
124,The should calm him ‘The Leopard’ cause of the shoes 🐆
125,Dude has zero personality. Best golfer on the planet right now but excruciatingly boring.
126,Isnt it a penalty at 10:42 ? He touched sand on his takeaway.
127,Next great one?
128,Why does he have to spit?...unless he’s just blown his caddie there really is no excuse for it
129,THATS GUCCI BRO
130,"the PGA is......................""glory's last shot"".    it has kind of a melancholy , ""end of summer"" feel to it?"
131,"Stunning round from Brooke, can the commentators please stop yapping, and please don't tell me what I can see for my self, its not radio. man do they yap a load a crap."
132,"THE SPLIT SCREEN AIN'T MAKIN' IT, MAN.  aRE U TELLING ME, WITH TODAYS TECHNOLOGY, YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET A CAMERA ELEVATED ABOVE THE TEE SO VIEWERS CAN WATCH THE FLIGHT OF THE BALL IN REAL TIME AND FROM A MEANINGFUL PERSPECTIVE?"
133,thats gucci brah
134,ALL THESE NUMBSKULLS IN THE GALLERY ARE THERE FOR WOODS BUT IT DIDN'T GO QUITE AS PLANNED. DID IT?   KOEPKA IS SHOWING THEM ALL HOW IT'S DONE......
135,Hate to say it but Brookes was my pick this week.  You need to hit it long off the tee but also be able to work it right or left. Not many have that power and ability to shape it like he does. Hope he can close it out. People who think Tiger had a shot this week don't know Bethpage Black.
136,A golf machine makes it look to easy.
137,I ain't gonna mess w/ ( ya ) him to much . he's good.but he's not up there w/the BIG BOYZ OF GOLF yet.🤔Philly the Mickelson Tiger the Woods & ? BUBBA the Watson .it takes years 😀hahaha good day & an lol to you
138,This guy is a freak
139,"@13:45 Guys shouting ""C'mmon Tiger"" are a disgrace. They're neither Tiger fans and also disrespecting Brooks solid performance!"
140,Ball trail were showing them dropping in rough.
141,"the best golfer in this generation, so sad he doesn't get the recognition he deserves, should be the number 1 golfer in the world"
142,I ain't gonna mess w/ ( ya ) him to much . he's good.but he's not up there w/the BIG BOYZ OF GOLF yet.🤔Philly the Mickelson Tiger the Woods & ? BUBBA the Watson .it takes years 😀hahaha good day & an lol to you
143,"I think the toughness of said course was over hyped.  The tops pros are working it slowly but surely.  It’s the driver that is doing this.  Nothing else.  In the fairway=birdie chances.  Easy slow greens.  Straight putts, pros will score.  Koepka most likely leads in fairways hit and putts.  Simple shit."
144,"The ratings just died, not even a million people will be watching the next 2 rounds. Brooks is the most unexciting, robotic player ever. Who’s so big headed that he claims majors are easy when he’s been on tour for 8 years and has 4 wins. He’s on a hot streak, whoop-de-doo."
145,John Cena of golf!

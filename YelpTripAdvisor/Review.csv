0,Great place to take in a hockey game or catch a bite to eat. Hotel is decent and plenty to do in area. Convenient location to Canalside and other attractions. Good for year around fun for families.  Easy to park
1,This is an awesome hotel - very modern. This was my second time staying here. I love the rooms (especially the upgraded room I got) - and the location. Parking very reasonable. The breakfast was pretty good too.
2,We stay here every Thanksgiving week and are always very pleased. The staff from valet service to the M Lounge to housekeeping are unfailingly friendly and helpful.  Interestingly we note there is very little staff turnover.  We see the same people year after year. The hotel…
3,"For the second year in a row, the staff at the Marriott Haborplace did a wonderful job: from check-in to directions, concierge support, answering my many questions and ending with check-out help. As an example Pearl, in the concierge area,  was very prompt in keeping the lounge…"
4,I love this hotel. Super friendly staff. Made me feel special as Marriott Platinum member. M club lounge had a great breakfast. I was upgraded to a suite and it was awesome. Wish I had more time to stay here. Will definitely be back.  You can’t beat the location.   
5,"This hotel is located next to the Hockey Arena and just about a block from the baseball park  The public tram that takes you for free through Main Street downtown is just steps away and is convient for commuting within downtown.  The hotel is modern, clean, and the restaurant…"
6,We have stayed at the Harborcenter several times and are never disappointed. The service is top shelf from the valets to the reception to the cleaning service and bar staff. Rooms are always clean and impeccable. Bar is convenient with a good selection.   A great choice. Tram is…
7,"We had stayed in a roadside Hampton Inn the night before and had commented on the lack of friendliness there.  Walking into the Marriott HARBORCENTER, we were greeted warmly and efficiently and were reminded immediately that this hotel was on an entirely different level…"
8,"Stayed here for an event next door at the Keybank Center. Lovely hotel, top notch service, beautiful rooms and views. Only thing I was not a fan of was the the price gauge for that night (for the event). My friends booked the same room 5 days before I booked mine, but they paid…"
9,"My wife and I decided on taking a road trip from NYC to Buffalo!  We took advantage of our Starwood membership and booked the Buffalo Marriott Harborcenter hotel and had the absolute best time here!  Loved our room, the service and especially the staff.  I have to give a shout…"
10,"When I think of hotels, the first things that come to mind are usually location, price, amenities, that kind of thing. From now on, when I think of the Buffalo Marriott HARBORCENTER the first thing that is going to pop into my head is the outstanding customer service. As an…"
11,The place is fabulous -  real cut above. Best service we have ever received - until departure using valet parking. 15 minutes of waiting when you already called down ahead of time is just too long.Dont know what the glitch was. Valet apologized for the delay.
12,"Nice hotel, great location, great room.   But the staff!  Everyone was professional,  helpful and knowledgeable.   Gracie in the restaurant was particularly good, what a sweetheart. She made us feel welcome both mornings."
13,"I am a frequent Marriott guest but this property is one of my all time favorites. It's location, updated amenities and super clean rooms are top notch but what sets it apart from others is how every member of the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home and…"
14,"One is really pressed to write anything negative about this hotel. Everything is excellent about this hotel. Rooms, service, parking, food is all way up there on the excellent scale. The one thing I didn't like was it's downtown location, which means one has to go through a…"
15,"This hotel has it all.  Beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great views, great service!  We have stayed here multiple times.  We once had an issue with a noisy neighbor, but the hotel dealt with it.   The food and drinks are great and we love to walk over to see the Sabres play…"
16,"We had a harbor view room on the 18th floor and it was great. Staff in this hotel are polite and very helpful. Bathrooms have pocket doors (super). In and out parking is a perk with a fee, but I prefer that over valet parking. Dining area is well managed."
17,Second year in a row here with daughters on a shopping trip. Last year I gave a positive review but this year .... even better. I have never had staff so concerned with customers at a hotel! The minute you walk in the lobby they are asking what you need. Even though there was no…
18,"We did a spur of the moment trip to Buffalo for Labor Day weekend with our 2 year old daughter. From check in to check out the stay was wonderful, room was clean, and housekeeping left the nicest note for a small tip that truly made us feel they appreciated every little bit…"
19,This hotel was absolutely beautiful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Buffalo New York. Tracy was the front desk Clerk during my stay and she was wonderful. Hotel was very clean and excellent customer service.
20,I messed up my family hotel reservations at a different Marriott in Buffalo and Harborcenter came to my rescue. They found two rooms for me on a minute notice and couldn’t be more welcoming. The rooms are modern and very well appointed. The staff was great. The lounge for…
21,"We stayed here because we attended a concert at Canal Side, it was convenient to just walk across street for the concert and ever more so after the show. Hotel was very clean, nicely furnished, and a great sleep quality bed. Valet parking was only $2 more than self parking ($18…"
22,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Buffalo, there is no question that this is the best hotel.  The rooms are great, very quiet with extremely comfortable beds.  The M Club serves breakfast for Platinum members.  The staff is very attentive.  Keep doing what you are doing…"
23,This is a great property with views overlooking the water.  Rooms are clean and comfortable. The service is excellent and amenities are also good.  Concierge lounge is clean and modern.  The restaurant fare is just ok which is unfortunate as there are times when you really don't…
24,"Great stay at the Marriott Harborcenter in Buffalo. Great location next to Canalside and the rink with large, clean rooms. Nice bathroom and shower. Lounge and M Club have nice views. Would recommend."
25,The Marriott at harbor center was very nice. The rooms are very clean and the staff is staff. We had concierge service and the breakfasts that were included were very good. The hotel is located across the street from the harbor park which had a lot of things going on. Navy ships…
26,"From beginning to end I was impressed by our stay here. We, my husband and I, arrived on a Thursday night. We stayed in a junior suite with a king bed and river view. We were on the 10th floor and it was beautiful. Once we got to our room I realized I forgot my phone in the car.…"
27,i enjoyed my stay at this hotel. no complaints. the club lounge is excellent with a good view. within walking distance of a lot. downside is the price. i asked for an exception to be able to stay here which probably wont happen again. bummer! 
28,My family and I will never stay at another hotel in downtown Buffalo.  By far the best hotel in the area and great view of the harbourfront.   The M Lounge is a little gem as a perk for Marriott Members.  The staff go above and beyond!   Thank you for each and every enjoyable…
29,"After the horror of staying overnight at a hotel nearby, Marriott is such a pleasure.   This hotel is clean, roomy, and the staffs are always smiling saying hello, they are so friendly. Hotel has water view as well as the city view, there aren't many tall buildings near by so…"
30,"We had dinner at Panorama on 7, What an AWESOME EXPERIENCE.  We were going to see the Eagles concert at the HSBC arena that night and the staff was very conscientious of our time.  Kim greeted us at the door and made us feel very welcomed. The restaurant was packed but we still…"
31,"From the moment we pulled up to the valet I knew this was a special place, his greeting and persona made me feel so welcome. Once at the front desk were welcomed by Casey who made check in a breeze and also suggested the upgrade to M club which was well worth it, I must say…"
32,"Beautiful property, great rooms, perfect location attached to Key Bank Center...  I travel extensively... 130 nights so far this year, and a senior contributor on TripAdvisor... so I know a great property when I see one.  But, the stand out here was the F&B manager... Kim Back,…"
33,"As soon as our car pulled up, we were greeted immediately.  Sean's shift was ending, but he took the time to take our luggage and show us to the Front Desk (located on the 7th floor) and tell us all about the area and places to go while we were there.  The lobby was absolutely…"
34,"We wanted a special hotel for our anniversary stay in Buffalo and this hotel fit the bill perfectly. The room was spacious and clean, the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom/ shower area was exceptional. The attentiveness of the staff was simply outstanding and they…"
35,As a Marriott Platinum Elite member is was a pleasant surprise that one of the best Marriotts that I have stayed at is in my home town of Buffalo-  Jackie at the front desk was out standing - I would definitely go back and highly recommend
36,"We stayed at the Marriott Harborcenter on June 2.  We travel often and it is one of our favorite hotels. Fresh, clean, and the employees are terrific.  We especially thanks Casey and Serhan who were working at the front desk.  I had a ""fashion emergency"" as I was preparing to…"
37,"This is a relatively new hotel and everything was wonderful. AAAA+ for all the staff, from the valet parking to the front desk, to the bar service and the staff in the M Club. Views of the harbor and HarborCenter are great!  The lobby is on the 7th floor, so you park and then…"
38,"We visited on May 25-26 2018. We found the staff to be excellent. Everyone from the Valet , housekeeping  and check in were wonderful. Room was very clean and comfortable.Our only concern was the service at the Café area. We stopped in after the Concert with friends. It took a…"
39,It couldn't be easier to see a concert if you stay there.  The hotel is connected to a parking garage and the Keybank Center so you don't even have to step outside.  You can go straight from your room and take the elevator to the concert.  If you do go outside there is plenty to…
40,"Being from Buffalo, I don't always have a chance to check out the various hotels in the city, especially properties like the Marriott Harborcenter that have just been built in the last few years. I am more than happy that I finally went to Panorama on Seven and was able to speak…"
41,Stayed over for three days to attend an event in downtown buffalo. The hotel is very well appointed and has valet parking for those with a car. I had a corner suite which was spacious and had views of the lake and facing northward. The suite was very nicely furnished as well but…
42,We did a business event here and I have to say the banquet staff are some of the best I have ever encountered.  Therese is an absolute gem!  Went above and beyond to accommodate our every wish and need.  Highly recommend doing a corporate event here.  Hotel is gorgeous and the…
43,This place was amazing. I wasn't expecting a Marriott property to be so modern with the wood style flooring and nice washroom. They had valet parking and self parking. The M Club access had breakfast and day and night snacks available including drinks. It was a very cozy spot to…
44,"My stay at the Buffalo Marriott at the Harborcenter was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. From start to finish, my stay was flawless thanks to one of the best, most proactive staffs around and the thought put into every detail of this beautiful property.   I…"
45,Met up with some friends for a weekend away to see a Sabres game followed by a night out. This hotel was perfect for the excursion. Modern and clean and next to the arena. Within walking distance to several bars and restaurants as well. The parking garage is attached to the…
46,"So I really enjoyed this Hotel. I had a top floor with the Canal view. Floor to ceiling windows kept the curtains open. The room was modern. nice features, great check in. I had dinner in the restaurant and ventured into the concierge suite being a gold Marriot member.  Dinner…"
47,"The rooms were large and comfortable. The hotel was beautiful. There was an amazing view and excellent places to walk around and enjoy. It was pricey , but well worth it. There were also several places to eat within walking distance. If you are going to a concert, it is a safe…"
48,Very friendly staff upon arrival. The concierge lounge is very nice and comfortable with a great selection of snacks.  The rooms are large - no desk in my room but rather an L-shaped couch with a table (works well for a room service meal and / or working on your laptop).…
49,"Spent 6 nights at the Harborcenter and cannot praise it highly enough. Friendly, attentive, courteous staff, excellently appointed room with a view over Lake Erie, superb breakfast and service, and excellent facilities with the gym and 716 Sports Bar being stand-outs. Would…"
50,"The views were beautiful from our room, and the service was great. The room was modern with a very comfortable bed and a great shower. We enjoyed the M lounge for some quiet snacks and drinks, as well as coffee in the morning. The proximity to canal side, the arenas, and…"
51,"Hotel is located right across the street to the arena.  And you can get into the arena without even having to go outside.  The hotel is also connected to 716 sports.  Check in and check out was easy.  Valley parking was $18 for the night.  Room was clean, quite and the bed was…"
52,Our family of 4 visited Buffalo over March Break to see a Leafs-Sabres hockey game.  This was a first for our family and thought that staying at the Marriott right next door to the KeyBank Center made perfect sense. The Marriott downtown Buffalo is a beautiful facility. …
53,"This hotel is located next to the KeyBank Center in downtown Buffalo. The hotel is newer and it's shows in the design and cleanliness of the common areas/rooms.   Being Marriott Lifetime Platinum, your check in gift options are points of $10 credit for drinks/food at the bar.…"
54,"It is difficult to put into few words on the experience I received from this hotel other than WOW!  This hotel is the gold standard for how customer service should be in any company, and management should be commended for making customer service top priority.  Every employee is…"
55,"One of those places just designed and run to the N'th degree. From world-class architectural planning and design to culinary specialties one only greater than the next, this place is as another writer said ""divine"", no better word. Let me talk about the Turkey, Bourbon Bacon,…"
56,"We stayed for one night to attend a hockey game. The hotel itself is beautiful, modern, and well appointed. Our King room was a city view, but we also had a great view of the lake which was a nice surprise. The room was very spacious and had huge windows, making it feel even…"
57,"The views are lovely,  and the hotel itself is amazing, but it was the staff, and especially Chan in the M lounge, who made our stay so very special. He was so helpful with everything and is such a gentleman.  Marriott is our ""go to"" hotel where ever we are in the world, and…"
58,"Had a follow up appointment at surgeon's office in Buffalo on the 15th, and could not tolerate the 3 hour round trip drive in one day, so we booked the 14th (Valentine's Day) at the hotel, to make the whole thing less grueling.  It was a painful ride into the city, and Jackie at…"
59,"We stayed here on night as a short getaway and to check out the waterfront revitalization area. Getting to the hotel parking was a bit of a challenge due to there being a concert that evening (well several events). Once in front of the hotel, valet was the easiest and not to…"
60,Very impressive staff.  Everyone I have encountered from the front desk to Panorama to the M lounge has been awesome. The bartender Joanna is great. 16th floor room is super nice. Only thing lacking is a desk to work at (modular table next to couch is sub optimal).  If in…
61,"I travel a lot but don't usually use Marriott because of a terrible experience in Steamboat Spring, CO. But we had a hockey tournament here so we booked here. Some of the staff especially at the desk are cold and just all business. But then some of the staff Go above and beyond…"
62,My friend and I were there for 5 nights during the World Hockey Jr. Championships. The Hotel was convenient due to the proximity to the Arena. We did not have to go outside in the frigid temperatures except for about a 40 yard walk through the parking garage to the Arena. The…
63,"First off it was the end of the night for the bar, they generally close at midnight, I called to see if they would still serve us at 11:55, they said no problem, we only wanted a night cap. Joey, the bartender already had the bar pretty much broken down, but unpacked everything…"
64,"We stayed two nights. The hotel was quite busy as the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was going on in the next door arenas and many of the hockey personnel were staying at the hotel. The hotel itself is quite modern, clean and has all the usual Marriott amenities.  Check…"
65,"I stayed here 11-16 Dec 2017 for a work trip. The service was very good. I cannot express how pleasant the staff was, from check-in to club room staff, to maid service, everyone was friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortable and clean and the hotel location was great.…"
66,"I took a trip to Buffalo recently, battling flight delays and inclement weather, eventually getting to the Marriott Harbor Center.  My first impression was that it is an impressive property and the staff is attentive and kind.  I travel frequently for work and stay exclusively…"
67,"After 3 months here the only complaint I have is that other hotels will struggle to match the level of service provided. All of the staff are friendly, welcoming and professional and the few niggles that are bound to happen on a stay of this length were handled brilliantly. Huge…"
68,"So it's our last night here in Buffalo! Staying at the AWESOME Buffalo Marriott Hotel HARBORCENTER... this has really been a home for Tiny and me since July!! Thank you guys, you have made us feel so at home!! All the staff have been incredible... Taylor, Erin Krystal and co…"
69,"This is a great hotel and it is next to the hockey arena.  The rooms were a nice size, the internet is reliable and the bar in the lobby was excellent.  The only thing that was a little different was that the drinks in the executive lounge during happy hour were not free.  But…"
70,"I typically stay at Hilton’s, but my mom has stayed at this Marriott several times and recommended it. I was in dismay when I arrived and the front desk staff was so rude I wanted to walk out and cancel the entire three night stay. The restaurant staff however is excellent and…"
71,This is my third time stay at this hotel and always been amazing  but the only down side is that some of the staff at the front desk are a little rude when you approch them to ask them a question.  specially if there are waken up i had seen the same person sleeping in differnt…
72,"This is a very nice hotel, and the location is great also.  Adjacent to the arena that the Buffalo Sabres play, along with 2 practice rinks make it a great hotel for Youth Hockey tournaments as well.  The beds were extremely comfortable!!!  I want one!!"
73,"we stayed here for 3 nights and found the hotel to our satisfaction, wonderful views of the lake, big clean rooms, helpful staff, nice location all the usual requirements you would need for a hotel, but in this day and age I get a little miffed when the hotel is still charging…"
74,"Excellent accommodations, everything you could want on site or within walking distance. Hotel restaurant has outstanding food and very good service. Nice bar and great views as well. Health club is small inadequate for aerobic activity, but not for lifting."
75,"One night quick trip with my wife to Niagara Falls and Buffalo this weekend. I had requested an 11am check in, as we were flying in from New York City that morning and really wanted to check in, clean up and get on our way. When we arrived at the hotel, not only was our room not…"
76,"Oddly enough, we planned to spend a night in Buffalo largely so we could see the Shark Girl statue in HarborCenter.  We hadn't really put two and two together when we snagged a bargain room at the Marriott HarborCenter, so we were delighted when we finally found our way to Shark…"

83,"Very nice hotel in a great location.  Near canalside and Keybank arena.  Views are outstanding.  Lakeview rooms are outstanding although city views are good too.  Rooms are impeccable, good furnishings etc."
84,"Took my daughters to Buffalo shopping for a day and stayed overnight at Marriott Harbour center. It was a good 10 minute walk to a more populated area but we didn't mind the Location. Ate close by at Pearl st brewery. Canal side looked promising for a morning of fun, but at 10…"
85,"We stayed at this hotel because family were staying there, but after spending our last night at a hotel near the airport for half the cost we wish we had staying there.  There are not many places to eat in walking distance of the hotel.  I did appreciate that when the tub didn't…"
86,I found this to be an excellent hotel. From the first staff member I encountered to the last all were very friendly. I could not get over how friendly the staff was. The room was very nice. Television allowed you to stream Netflix and youtube as well as others. The bathroom was…
87,I have stayed four times this summer for business and for a person who has stayed at several JW Marriotts and Ritz Cartlons this Marriot is equal or better than all of them.  The location of the hotel is amazing where you are on the waterfront of the Canalside area where you can…
88,Stayed here two nights for business attending a conference at the hotel. Not hockey season yet but if it was the hotel perfect since it is adjacent to the home of the Sabres at the Key Bank Center.   First the conference facilities are top notch and the people at the hotel are…
89,"Except for the fact that you park and then have to take two elevators to get to your room.  The first to the 7th floor lobby and the second to the rooms, this is a Marriott through and through, restaurant, room service, concierge room, exercise rooms were all nice.  View of the…"
90,I have been at the hotel for two consecutive weeks with a break on the weekend and the overall experience has been positive. It is a relatively new hotel in an area with alot of activities around it including canalside which has some type of event going on most evenings. The…

93,"The windows were so filthy and covered with bugs I could barely see out of them.  They said they were doing their ANNUAL window cleaning the next day.  I was upgraded to a water front view.  I looked out on the Skyway, the projects and a very loud concert that kept me awake.  I…"
94,Stayed here for a weekend with a few couples. The rooms were nice. Not huge but good size. No work desk in the room was a bit of a negative as was check in on the 7th floor with a needed elevator to get to floors with rooms. On the positive is the concierge lounge was better…
95,"Stayed here two nights for a business trip.  Hotel location is right down on the Buffalo Harbor next to the hockey arena. There is plenty of  garage self parking available as well as a convenient valet.  The hotel layout is strange, you take an elevator to the 7th floor lobby,…"
96,I was pleasantly surprised by this Harbor front Marriott in downtown Buffalo.  The hotel was easy access to all the events going on by the harbor and within easy distance to downtown Buffalo. Uber was allowed into Buffalo two weeks ago and it very easy and affordable to travel…

98,"I would love to give  them raving revues but I can't. There are a couple of things that I feel are very important to providing a great vacation. For one thing I expect to get what I pay for. To start with, we paid extra for a riverside view. The view was great...what you could…"

100,This is a beautiful hotel with a great location now that Buffalo is starting to come back to life. My main complaints and problems with this property stem from their billing practices. Two issues:  1) I stayed here on a Saturday night after a wedding reception. Came back to the…
101,"I have one tiny complaint, the shower head. I felt like it was raining and found it rather difficult to even wash my hair. Turns out this is some energy saving situation. But, everything else was perfect. Location, staff, cleanliness, room, rink, fitness, transportation. We used…"
102,The location right across the street from The Canalside boardwalk was perfect!  Appeared newly renovated. Comfortable and clean. Beautiful sunset views and views of Lake Erie. There was a train stop in front of the hotel too.
103,"Stayed there for one night on a road trip. Location was great, right next to the lake (ask for a lake view room). Great places to eat nearby. Parking is a bit of a pain -- we did valet parking. Hotel is in a high rise -- the lobby is on the 7th floor and the rooms above that.  …"
104,"This is a fairly new Marriott. The concierge lounge is better than most. The lobby ( on the7th floor) is attractive and inviting. Rooms are large, airy and inviting.  My favorite Buffalo home away from home. "
105,"This is a new hotel right next to the Harborcenter (where the Sabres play) and the new Canalside area in downtown Buffalo.  I was there for business, and as usual, the Marriott didn't disappoint.  The hotel is very modern and sleek and is in a great spot if you're in the area…"

108,"New modern hotel. Faux wood flooring rather than carpets in rooms, which I like. NO DESK, but a settee with a low table that kind of works OK. Rooms are spacious. Really comfortable mattress. For gold members, free hi-speed internet and m club with free brunch and happy hours.…"
109,We stayed here while wrapping up our Niagara Falls trip prior to flying home. We're glad we stayed.  This is a very modern and new property. It is adjacent to the Harborside public park on the Erie Canal which is a great place to walk and enjoy the water. It is also a short walk…
110,Great hotel with all new furnishings.  Very clean and comfortable.  Stayed there the day before the John Bennett regatta and it was an excellent location due to its proximity.  The only challenge is that my GPS had trouble guiding me there and back to the regatta site.I had free…
111,Celebrated the end of chemotherapy and radiation for a loved one. They were outstanding in accommodating the special requests for the teens. The views of the city are breathtaking. The service is amazing. 
112,"I'll begin with the only negative I can think of, is the elevators.  It is required to first go to the Check in level, then switch to a different elevator to get to the suites.  Kind of a hassle everytime.  I'm sure they do this for security because it is connected to a hockey…"
113,"We travel often and rarely do we find a hotel with the customer service deserving of comment.  Upon arrival at the valet, Bill, greeted us warmly and is a fabulous ambassador the Marriott brand.  He was attentive, personable, and respectful of our needs.  Although this hotel has…"

115,We stayed one night while attending a Sabres game. The valet parking was excellent and we were actually checked in at noon which was great.The hotel lobby is on the 7th floor along with a nice bar. There is access to the 716 sports bar and the Key Bank Centre without going…

117,"I had a nice stay at this hotel last weekend. The room itself was updated and clean. The service I received from everyone was stellar. The reason for my average review was that the room service food was meh - not that my expectations are ever high for room service, but they…"
118,"This was a great hotel.  The place is spotless, the beds are comfortable, the room quiet, and the location perfect.  I can't find fault with this place at all.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  All the staff we encountered were so friendly, and always went out of…"

121,"We were there for the NCAA Tournament, and we chose this hotel because it is so convenient--attached to the arena. The room was very comfortable, spacious, and kept spotlessly clean. Staff were great. The fitness room was adequate. Our only complaint was breakfast. My husband's…"
122,"Stayed at the new Marriott and although the views are amazing (for buffalo) and the staff was amazing, the hotel itself doesn't deserve the tag ""luxury"" more does it deserve the price tag of $200+. At 125 it would have gotten 5 stars but it's the fact that it's basically a…"
123,"We stayed in this hotel on our hockey trip last year, and had no hesitation in returning this time round. Standards have remained high in all aspects. This time round, our room overlooked the lake and the view was magnificent. Beds are comfortable, and if you are attending any…"
124,Booked this hotel as we were going to the hockey game and knew it was closeby and we would not have to drive.  Well the nice surprise is that the hotel is physically attached to arena through Parking Garage so you do not even have to go outside.  We were there a few weeks ago…
125,This hotel is beautiful inside and the beds are super comfortable.  I was pleased with the bathroom amenities.  It smells brand new inside.  Great lounge area.  Very helpful staff and modern décor.  Highly recommend to stay at this classy Marriott.  We did a late check out and…
126,"So my husband travels a lot for work and tends to stay at Marriotts. They reward loyalty, he's platinum. When you are platinum they upgrade your room, you have access to the special lounge, they just treat you really well. Staying here was amazing, not sure if they treat…"
127,"I stayed at the Marriot Harbor Center for the weekend when I attended a concert at the Key Bank Center. The hotel connects directly to the center through the parking garage. No rental car, driving or parking needed. It was literally a 5 minute walk to the concert!  Great…"
128,Beautiful Hotel. Fantastic location on awesome lake view rooms. Loved the rink area. Very helpful staff. Highly recommend to see the guy the works overnights at the deskhe would make anything happend even run to the drugstore for you bar area is amazing. Just be aware parking…
129,"This place is great.  A bit pricey for Buffalo, but very nice hotel.   Outside skating rink is walking distance away.  The Sabres play next door.   The kids played a tourney in the same building as the hotel.    716 restaurant is good, again a little pricey for Buffalo.   …"
130,New and very clean accommodations in BUF that is attached to the Sabres Ice complex.  Modern rooms with nice amenities in the hotel.  We happened to be there when the SJ Sharks were in town and they stayed on our floor.  Very quiet and peaceful venue with great views of the…
131,My wife and I are looking at possible relocation to Buffalo. The Marriott is a first class stay from the valet guys to check in. The view from the room is superb. The room is a great oasis and amenities are perfect. Room layout is awesome. Hotel is central to all points in…
132,"This new hotel is beautiful, modern, state of the art and comfortable.  Restaurants and bars seemed very popular.  Food was great.  Easy walk indoors to the Hockey arena and Buffalo Sabres games.  Great gym for workouts and nice to have multiple ice rinks in the building were we…"
133,A nicely designed hotel for the business traveler. Conference rooms are large enough to accommodate a large group of people. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is onsite fitness equipment and restaurants. The views are impressive. 
134,"We stayed at the Buffalo Marriot recently for a hockey tournament.  The facilities are great, the tournament was run out of this hotel.  The hockey arenas are on the 6th floor as well as Impact training center.  The venue was well run our team had a great time  Very convenient. …"
135,I have to say this is my first night and I'm the customer service is incredible!!! Chelsea went way above any call of duty! Thank you so much Chelsea you deserve a raise and promotion. Tabetha was also incredible. The management here has definitely done some training!!!!! …
136,"We usually stay over night in Buffalo when we go back to Ontario Canada. This time we chose Marriott Harborcenter instead of other airport Marriott brands. As Marriott's highest level elite member, platinum premiere, the front desk did not even offer the points and greetings. I…"
137,"Very nice hotel.   We chose the Marriott Buffalo Harbor Center as the staging area for our trip to Canada.  We enjoyed the Harbor Center area.  Close to the waterfront market, shops and some restaurants in walking distance.  Short drive to the bridge to cross into Canada. …"
138,"We stayed after an event in the Key Bank Center. Rooms were nice and location was convenient. It is pricy if you do not get a deal. Room service menu is somewhat limited. Also, if you go to 716 restaurant they make you walk outside in garage. They should have put inside hallway…"
139,Excellent check-in with enthusiastic and well trained desk team.  There is an attached parking garage where you can self park and pay a reasonable charge.  Valet service is also available.  The hotel is connected to the arena where the Buffalo Sabres play their home games. …
140,Stayed here for a sabres game in December and was highly impressed by everything this hotel had to offer.  The valet service was very efficient and was only $20/night.  The front desk staff was probably the most friendly and professional hotel staff I've ever had the pleasure to…
141,"Hotel is modern, clean and convenient.  All of those advantages are lost due to the piss poor management of the hotel.  Staff is rude.  Bar staff is incredibly rude.  On-site restaurant / room service menu is horrible.  There aren't that many hotels to choose from in downtown…"
142,"Oh my goodness where do I start?  We came to Buffalo to support our grandson playing college basketball.  From the valet parking to the check in process, everyone was very friendly.  A little different to find the check in on the 7th floor.  One confusing part is the elevators…"
143,"The Buffalo harbour area is a work in progress. There's little doubt this brand new Marriott property will one day anchor a thriving, vital city centre. For now, it's a bit of an outpost on nights when there are no events at the Key Bank arena next door, or the public spaces…"
144,I can't say enough great things about this hotel. I took the train into Buffalo Exchange Station and it was an easy walk to the hotel. I will admit that I was confused when I first entered the hotel on the ground level. There is a Tim Horton's on that level and two elevators.…
145,"This hotel has a great location in Buffalo.  Great views of the lake. Modern look and feel.   The front desk staff was excellent.  I left my wallet in my car on the way to dinner at 716, the restaurant attached to the hotel.  He said he would retrieve my wallet and send it to my…"
146,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay here. The harbor view room was nice but there were a number of little things that fell short of our expectations. The staff are very attentive, which made it even stranger that things like missing light bulbs and towels occurred.  I'll definitely…"
147,"Stayed during a non event weekend in Buffalo in summer, location made all the difference because our family, with young kids, loved every moment. Great room, so much fun to walk around.Self parked, non event price was very reasonable."
148,"Where to begin with this hotel Their business is 'sleep' and it's impossible to do that when they cannot locate a (pre-ordered) crib for a baby, and have large groups of teens staying there.  If you want a hotel that just looks great - then this place delivers, it looks the…"
149,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel when we went to a Leafs/Sabres game. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to an event, as it is connected to the Key Bank Center so you don't have to go outside and it has its own ticket takers so you don't have to…"
150,"I don't think that my review of this hotel can encapsulate my true gratitude toward the staff at this hotel, however I am going to try. To begin, the property itself is gorgeous.  Built about a year ago, it is clean, modern, and in an excellent location. Now, let me provide the…"
151,"This hotel has done a lot right.  They are fairly new, and the staff are all very friendly.  You enter on the ground floor and have to go to the 7th floor to check in.  Although some may find this annoying, as you have to take 2 different elevators, from a safety perspective…"
152,"This is a great hotel in an even better location. It's right on the metro so transportation around town isn't a problem. Also there is always something going on near the harbor including sports, concerts, and festivals. It's a great new hip portion of Buffalo. "
153,"Great Hotel in the middle/close to everything downtown Buffalo. Hockey Arena, Harbor, Casino and warships all within walking distance from hotel. Nice little breezeway for walking along the harbor. The rooms in the hotel are really nice. Great views from either side. Also, there…"
154,Fantastic facility. Kim and the restaurant/ bar staff are complete professionals. If you are in downtown Buffalo this place should not be missed.  Great views of the harbor and the food and drinks are top notch. 
155,"I knew this was a newer Marriott, but I was surprised -- pleasantly surprised -- at just how new this hotel was.  While it's been open for a year, it still felt like it just opened.   I was also pleasantly surprised at the excellent staff; most of whom seemed young and…"
156,"New hotel overlooking Canalside in Buffalo & connected to the hockey arena. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Room service was prompt & the food was great. Quaint shops with Buffalo flair located on the lower level, not to mention Tim Hortons! They have an impressive setup for…"
157,One of the nicest Marriot's you will find. Perfect location if you are staying downtown for a Sabres game or Canalside event. Extremely modern rooms with fabulous views of Lake Erie and downtown Buffalo. Would highly recommend it.
158,This is definitely the best hotel in Buffalo. It is a great hotel with very comfortable beds.  The only downside the hotel has it that the check in is not on the ground floor which i see to be a pain sometimes.
159,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights for a trip to Niagara Falls with my mother.  It was the most awesome experience.  We stayed on the 16th floor with a view of Lake Erie that was simply beautiful.  Everything about this hotel is awesome, EVERYTHING!"
160,"Spacious rooms. Very friendly staff. Top notch service.  Front desk staff, reward's club hosts, cleaning staff and valet were all excellent. Great views! I will definitely stay here when I'm in Buffalo again! Visit Niagara Falls while in the area! "
161,"Clean, modern and easy access to hockey rink!  We stay at the Marriott Harborcenter each time we visit Buffalo.  Very nice property with modern rooms and decor.  Walk to hockey rink entrance.  Away teams often stay here as Ive bumped into my favorite players several times in the…"
162,"The new Marriot is in a great location for downtown Buffalo. It is an easy walk to the waterfront. The ice rinks are on lower levels and during hockey season Sabres players can be spotted in the lobby or club room. The room was big, clean and had a city view. The bed was very…"
163,"Really liked this hotel. Very clean and modern. Excellent service by all the staff we encountered. Might need more dining options, as there was nothing available on a busy Saturday for dinner. Rooms were quite nice. We had a view which was nice. Showers had poor water pressure.…"
164,I stayed at the Buffalo Marriott Harbor Center for a weekend in August. They charge $10 a day for Wi-Fi which is free at many other hotels. They also charge $18 a day for parking which is ridiculous because there's really no other place to park in that area. Just off the lobby…
